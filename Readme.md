# DL

A deep learning project where I work through the Ian Goodfellow book on deep learning (TODO: reference). I will try to 
recreate everything in the book in Go, but might use some established python libraries once in a while. My goal is to
become familiar with Go, and, of course, get better in deep learning.

## TODO List

- [ ] Add errors to Matrix operations
- [ ] Add comments to Matrix functions
- [ ] Create interfaces for matrices and vectors operations
